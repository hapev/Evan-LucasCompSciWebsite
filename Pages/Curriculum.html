    </h1>

       <p class = closer>
    This year long course provides an overview of the role of a software engineer, different aspects of the profession, and the different kinds of programming that one would use for web development projects. Students will use HTML, processing, scripting languages and Python throughout the duration of the course as they learn about the various concepts and possibilities of design as it relates to the wearable arts, visual arts, front-end web and game development. In this programming course, students learn new tools and materials that are imperative to becoming a good programmer. A strong emphasis is placed on producing efficient, quality programming code when completing each assignment. Topics include analyzing data solely through computational means, applying software engineering techniques and processes and exploring current tech trends.

              </div>

        <p class = closer> All work will be collected at the beginning of the class period of the due date. Unless it is due to an emergency situation or an illness, if work is turned in late then, a penalty of 10% will be applied every day after it is due. No late work will be accepted beyond the third day after the due date. Why? You are in an Advanced Level course that moves at a fast pace. This is put into place to prevent students from falling behind with their work, thus possibly affecting the pace of the course and overall student learning.</p>
